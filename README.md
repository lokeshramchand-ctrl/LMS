## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- Identify the problem and objectives
- Define functional and non-functional requirements
- Document Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
- Validate requirements with stakeholders

## Phase 2: System Design
- Create high-level architecture (ER diagrams, UML, flowcharts)
- Design database schema
- UI/UX prototyping
- Define API specifications (if applicable)
- Prepare technical documentation

## Phase 3: Implementation
- Set up development environment
- Code individual modules based on design
- Follow best coding practices and maintain version control (Git)
- Conduct code reviews
- Maintain proper documentation

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- Integrate modules and ensure proper communication
- Perform unit testing on each component
- Conduct integration testing
- Execute system and performance testing
- Fix bugs and optimize performance

## Phase 5: Deployment
- Deploy the application to a production environment
- Configure necessary servers and hosting (Firebase, AWS, etc.)
- Perform final testing in a live environment
- Prepare user manuals and support documentation

## Phase 6: Maintenance
- Monitor application performance
- Fix reported issues and bugs
