## Business Requirements
- Enable instructors to create and manage courses
- Provide students with easy access to course materials
- Implement progress tracking and assessment features
- Facilitate communication through discussion forums
- Ensure secure authentication and role-based access control


## System Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- User registration and authentication
- Course management (create, update, delete courses)
- Content delivery (videos, PDFs, quizzes, assignments)
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Discussion forums and messaging system
- Role-based access control

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability to handle multiple institutions
- Secure user data storage and management
- High availability and minimal downtime
- Optimized performance for web and mobile devices

## Architecture Design
- **Frontend:** Flutter (for cross-platform compatibility)
- **Backend:** Django
- **Database:** MySQL (relational storage)
- **Authentication:** Face authetication with User Login
- **API Communication:** RESTful APIs

## Database Schema
- **Users** (id, username, email, password, role)
- **Courses** (id, title, description, instructor_id, start_date, end_date)
- **Modules** (id, course_id, title, content)
- **Enrollments** (id, user_id, course_id, enrollment_date)
- **Assignments** (id, course_id, title, description, submission_deadline)
- **Submissions** (id, assignment_id, user_id, submission_file, grade)

## UI/UX Design
- **Student Dashboard:** View enrolled courses, track progress
- **Instructor Dashboard:** Create/manage courses, grade assignments
- **Course Page:** Video lectures, assignments, discussions
- **Discussion Forum:** Real-time Q&A and collaboration

## Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1:** Requirements Analysis (User research, feature definition)
- **Phase 2:** System Design (Architecture, UI/UX prototyping)
- **Phase 3:** Development (Backend APIs, Frontend UI, Database setup)
- **Phase 4:** Integration & Testing (Unit testing, system testing, bug fixes)
- **Phase 5:** Deployment (Hosting, security measures, domain setup)
- **Phase 6:** Maintenance (Bug fixes, user feedback, updates)

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Validate individual components
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure seamless interaction between modules
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Validate functionality with actual users
- **Performance Testing:** Load testing and optimization

## Deployment Plan
- Deploy backend on cloud hosting (AWS/GCP)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

## Maintenance & Support
- Monitor system performance and server uptime
- Roll out feature updates based on user feedback
- Regular security audits and patches
- Provide customer support via email or chatbot
